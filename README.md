# The Soul Terminal

In the Soul Terminal, you play as the Grim Reaper's assistant, deciding whether or not souls that the Reaper sends to you should board the plane to heaven or hell. Use the information about the souls' lives (found on their passport, luggage, and boarding pass) to make the right decision. This game was made in Godot.

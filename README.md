# The Soul Terminal

In the Soul Terminal, you play as the Grim Reaper's assistant and decide whether or not souls that the Reaper sends to you should board the plane to heaven or hell. Use the information about the souls' lives (found on their passports, luggage, and boarding passes) to make the right decision. This game was made in Godot.
